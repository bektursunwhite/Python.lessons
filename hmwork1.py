#   # Trying to count lenght of the input:
# # sentence = input("Please enter a word: ")
# # char_count = len(sentence)
# # print(char_count)

#   #More options: 
# # sentence = input("Enter a sentence/word: ")
# # char_count = len(sentence)
# # print(f"The sentence has {char_count} words") 
############## The main command is len(sentence) >>>>>>>> helps us to count lenght of words or sentences


#   # Trying to reverse input: 
# word = input("Please enter your word: ")
# re_word = word[::-1]
# print(f"The reversed word of {word} is {re_word}")

    # more options:
# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# reversed_word = word[::-1]
# print(f"Reversed word: {reversed_word}")
   
    #    or just
# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# re_word = word[::-1]
# print(re_word)            
################# The main command is [::-1] >>>>>> helps us to reverse anything


## Trying to reverse numbers ot digits: 
# num = input("Please enter a number: ")
# re_num = num[::-1]
# print(re_num) 
################# We can also make it more advanced with putting option "f" 
################# The main command is [::-1] >>>>>>>>>> helps us to reverse.. 


## Palindrome :) 
# word = input("Please enter a word: ")
# pali_word = word == word[::-1]
# print(pali_word)
################## In this task i found out the next command  == word[::-1] >>>>>>> helps us to find out palindrome words

 ## Swaping values: 
# num1 = input("Hey enter your first number: ")
# num2 = input("Enter your second number: ")

# num1, num2 = num2, num1 

# print(num1 , num2)  
################### It was quite complicated task..

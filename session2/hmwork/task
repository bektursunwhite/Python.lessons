### Trying to count vowels in input: 

sentence = input("Please enter a word: ")

vowel = "aeiouAEIOU" 
vowel_count = sum(1 for char in sentence if char in vowel)
print(vowel_count) 

########## in this task i learnt about "sum". As i understand "sum" gives us a total of smt.. 
# Example(from ChatGpt):

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# total = sum(numbers)
# print(total)

# This adds 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. And the output should be 15. 


########## Let's do the same task but with a tool that we have learnt with Esen. >> 
 
sentence = input("Please enter your word: ")

vowel = "aeiouAEIOU"

vowel_counter = 0
for char in sentence:
     if char in vowel: 
         vowel_counter += 1
print(vowel_counter) 

########### Now it feels familiar to me.. But smt new here is "+=".,  So "+=" will increase counter one by one.
#### Examples: counter == counter + 1 
#              counter += 1       (both options are the same)
